The purpose of this project is to predict the score of the match based on the past games of these clubs since 1993 ‚öΩÔ∏èüìä. Based on these results, you can roughly understand who is the favorite of the match. Although football is an unpredictable game, I think all fans of this sport would be interested to see the estimated score of the match and its percentage of the possible outcome.
